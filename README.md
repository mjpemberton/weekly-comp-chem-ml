# Machine Learning in Chemistry Weekly Digest

Welcome! This repository hosts a **weekly curated digest of recent literature at the intersection of machine learning and chemistry**.

For the past year, I have been compiling weekly research summaries of publications relevant to my own work and sharing them internally within my research group. I have decided to make these digests public in the hope that they may be useful to the wider computational chemistry and molecular machine learning community.

My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computational organic chemistry, with a particular emphasis on applications in pharmaceutical development and drug discovery. As a result, while many of the selected publications fall within this domain, the scope of the digest is intentionally broad and reflects the rapidly evolving landscape of machine learning across the chemical sciences.

Each weekly update categorises publications into one of the following eight areas:

- **Machine-Learned Potentials & Molecular Simulation**
- **Quantum Chemistry & Electronic Structure with ML**
- **Drug Discovery, ADME & Chemical Biology**
- **Molecular Representation, Graphs & Foundation Models**
- **Generative Models & Molecular Design**
- **Reaction Prediction, Mechanisms & Synthesis Planning**
- **Autonomous Labs, Agents & AI-Driven Experimentation**
- **Data, Benchmarks, Tools & Reproducibility**

The digest aggregates publications from a wide range of venues, including journals published by Springer Nature, ACS, RSC, Wiley, and others, as well as relevant preprints.

Please note that none of the work listed here is my own (unless explicitly indicated in the author list). I do not own any of the referenced content, and some of the work highlighted here appears as preprints and has not yet undergone peer review. This repository is intended solely as a **community resource for information dissemination and discovery**.

If you notice an important paper that I have missed, or come across work you believe would be relevant to include, contributions and suggestions are very welcome.
